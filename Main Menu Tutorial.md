# Prerequisite
## The following tuorial will explain how to make a main menu in Unity 3D. This will include how to make the main menu load in and have a functioning play button. If you want a main menu tutorial with a options and quit button then this tutorial is not for you. Also I expect you to know how to make a new scene for this tutorial.

# Tutorial
1)You'll want to right click in the hiearchy area in a brand new scene and go down to UI and look for button text mesh pro and click on that.

2)Once you do that your gonna want to name it play but its okay to keep it as button.

3)You'll then want to click on canvas and create a script for it and add it as a component to canvas. You can call it main menu or whatever is convenient for you.

4)You'll then open the script and then you'll add in this beneath 'using UnityEngine;' so that it will help manage the levels/scenes.

5)Then you'll add in this piece of code which will make the main menu a public class so it can be used/read by any script. You'll then create a public void for the play button & after you'll add in the scenemanager code so that it can load the first level when you click play.

6) You'll then go back to unity and make these changes to the button so that it can have access to the script you made, so that it can function as a play button.

And if it all works right then it should look something like this:
