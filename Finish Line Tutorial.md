## The following tutorial will explain how to make a finish line/ end point to your level to your game in Unity 3D. This will help you learn how to make an end to your level, but not a game over so this might not be a tutorial suited for you.
## I followed this tutorial to make this by Hackingtons Code School https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q90cUrm4LYo however for people who need to make this in 2D then follow the original tutorial instead of this one.
1) First your going to want to make a new script for this, it can be called anything you want but I'll call it endpoint.

2) Then your going to create something for your character to interact with or in this collide with so I made a wall for this collide with(note, if you don't plan on having it collide to progress to a new level then don't follow the rest of the tutorial. Next your going to give it a box collider so that your player character doesn't phase through it & your going to attach your script to the wall.

3)After you'll go into the script and add this line of code under 'using unityengine'
