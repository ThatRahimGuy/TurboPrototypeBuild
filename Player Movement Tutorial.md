# Player Movement Tutorial
## The following tutorial will explain how to make your player move in Unity 3D. This includes the character moving in multiple directions and being able to jump.
1) Start by creating a C# called Player Movement(you can do this by right clicking in the asset are, selecting create and then clicking on C# script, also don't put a space in it or it won't work).

2) You'll want to left click which will bring you into MS Visual Studio where under public class you'll want to create these floats. What the public & private floats. What they will do is assign a value of speed and jump force(how fast the character will go and jump), private rigid body will allow the character to feel forces so your character can move because if your character cannot recieve forces then the speed & jump force will be for nothing. What the next three variables do is help the character jump by allowing the character to jump with bool jump which detects whether or not the character is jumping (which will be helpful when we move onto the character jump part of the tutorial). Float horizontal & vertical allow it so that the character can move in any direction whilst in air, whether the character is catapulted in a certain direction or if theyâ€™re jumping and using the keys to change directions. ![Capture 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b4fc5af-47dc-4d23-99f3-a64a98822846)

3) Then under void start, make this variable so that the code can reference the rigid body to
