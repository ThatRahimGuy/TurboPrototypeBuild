# Third Person Camera Tutorial
## The following tutorial will explain how to make a third person camera in Unity 3D. This includes how to do it over the shoulder only, if you'd like to change perspectives or do a different angle, this tutorial isn't much help for that.
## And I followed this tutorial to make it by Game Dev Box https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgSvNcbQ6qQ
1)Start by going to the services tab and clicking on explore. Once you get there a page like this should appear this is the unity package manager which has a libary of packages to install and manage(if its blank its fetching the packages and resources).

2)The list is in alphabetical order so scroll down to cinemachine and click install(it doesn't say install here cause it already is installed)

3) When its installed then you'll want to exit the unity package manager and go to your hiearchy and right click inside to go to cinemachine and add a virtual camera.

4) Then when you have your virtual camera in the hierachry then you can add the player character into the follow and look at sections and then it should have no issue fuctioning afterwards.
